# HardwareDataLogger

[![CI Pipeline](https://github.com/RobertGawron/HardwareDataLogger/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RobertGawron/HardwareDataLogger/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

## Summary

**_TL;DR It can collect, display, and store data locally and remotely, interfacing with various other devices._**

This project realizes a shield for the STM32F103RBTx with the following features:

* Pulse counting from up to four devices (e.g., Geiger counters) with logic levels from 3.3V to 16V, using SMA connectors.
* Data acquisition from measurement devices via UART, utilizing a DB9 connector.
* User interface with a 128x160 RGB LCD, four navigation buttons (up/down/left/right), and automatic LCD dimming in low light.
* UART over USB for transferring logged data to an external PC.
* microSD card for permanent data storage.
* WiFi capability for remote data transfer.

## Software

#### STM32F103RBTx Board
The STM32F103RBTx serves as the main microcontroller, handling data acquisition, processing, storage, and user interaction.

* Toolchain: C++17, C, STM32 VS Code Extension, CMake.
* [More info.](./Software/STM32F103RBTx/README.md)

#### ESP8266
The ESP8266 is currently used for data transfer via WiFi and will support FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air) in the future.

* Toolchain: TBD, currently using Arduino IDE.
* [More info.](./Software/ESP8266MOD/README.md)

#### DevOps

It's good to let the machine handle the tedious work of checking code quality, freeing up more time for the useful and interesting parts of software development.

* Toolchain: Unit tests (Google Test, Google Mock), code coverage (LCOV), static code analysis (Cppcheck), dynamic code analysis (Valgrind), Docker (for both local development and CI), GitHub Actions (CI).

* [Info how to use Docker to build the project.](./DevOps/README.md)


## Hardware

Due to the availability of low-cost, high-quality PCB manufacturing, home-etched PCBs have become largely obsolete. While the PCB design for this project may be difficult to etch at home, it is still possible. [Subparts of the circuit can be assembled on a breadboard, making the process much easier](./Documentation/Pictures/Device_30_08_2021.jpg), and the modular software design allows for easy reuse of these components.

* Toolchain: KiCad

## Simulation

Embedded development is cool, but constantly flashing the target device for non-hardware-related logic, like the human-machine interface, can be time-consuming and frustrating. To streamline this, a simulation was developed that isolates the firmware not directly tied to hardware, adds stubs for drivers, and includes a GUI. This allows all high-level aspects, such as whatâ€™s displayed on the LCD, user interaction via buttons, and data parsing, to be tested without the need for hardware.

While this simulation handles the firmware, speed of execution isn't a concern since it focuses solely on high-level logic. For hardware or driver-related issues, traditional methods like using an oscilloscope or logic analyzer are still necessary, as the simulation cannot be used.

* Toolchain: pyqt6, cmake.
